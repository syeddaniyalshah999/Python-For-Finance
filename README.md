# 📊 Optimized Portfolio vs S\&P 500 Benchmark

This project applies portfolio optimization techniques to construct an efficient portfolio of top-performing stocks and compares its performance against the S\&P 500 benchmark over a 6-month period. It uses historical stock data, calculates optimal asset weights based on the Sharpe Ratio, and visualizes the results with performance metrics and graphs.

## 🚀 Features

* 📈 Fetches stock data using `yfinance`
* 🧠 Identifies top gainers over the past 6 months
* 📊 Calculates optimal portfolio weights (Sharpe Ratio maximization)
* 🧮 Computes portfolio returns, volatility, and cumulative growth
* 📉 Compares with S\&P 500 (benchmark)
* 📌 Visualizes results using `matplotlib`

## 🔧 Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* `pandas`, `numpy`
* `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
* `yfinance`
* `scipy.optimize`
